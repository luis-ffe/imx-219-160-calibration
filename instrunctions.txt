pictureTaker      - makes ./pictureTaker that you can use to take pictures pressing space ( built for the jetson nano adapt it to your needss)
calibrateCam     - run this with the images of the chessboard here to generate the calibration yml file
undistortedCam    - uses the previous generated yml to make a live view of the camera with no distortion




PS:
I used the calibration chessboard image available at openCV website.
The paramathers of each square of the chessboard image size and quantity should all be set on the code for a correct calibration generation.
Take the pictures with your camera of you chessboard and use those to calibrate.

Optimization:
For greater performance a calibration mao should be initialized to then remap the frames of your chosing.
This greatly improves speed.
